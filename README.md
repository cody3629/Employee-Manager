# Employee Tracker

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, my challenge was to create and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.


## Description
* Functioning application that adds, removes, and lists employees/roles/departments in a company.
